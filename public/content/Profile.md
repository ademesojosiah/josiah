## About
A Backend Developer with a strong background in JavaScript/typescript. I have experience in the development of APIs. I make use of JavaScript as my primary programming language, taking advantage of its synchronous and asynchronous(NodeJS) system and other advanced features to write code that is both clear and easily maintainable. My toolset includes technologies such as Typescript Nodejs, Express, nest js ,Sql, NoSql dbs and I also use other tools like Jest for testing and Git for version control.
